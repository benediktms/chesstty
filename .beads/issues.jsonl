{"id":"ct-launch.3","title":"Handle daemonize-to-async boundary","description":"The shim has a tricky execution flow: sync (parse CLI) → sync (Daemon::new().start() which forks) → async (wait_for_socket + launch TUI). The daemon child also goes sync → async (create tokio runtime + run server).\n\nDesign main.rs flow:\n1. Parse CLI args (sync, before any fork)\n2. If default mode and server not running:\n   a. Build Daemon with builder pattern:\n      ```rust\n      let stdout = File::create(config.log_path())?;\n      let stderr = stdout.try_clone()?;\n      Daemon::new()\n          .pid_file(config.pid_path())\n          .working_directory(\"/tmp\")\n          .umask(0o027)\n          .stdout(stdout)\n          .stderr(stderr)\n          .start()?;\n      // We are now the daemon — start server\n      let rt = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()?;\n      rt.block_on(server::run(config.socket_path()))?;\n      return Ok(()); // daemon exits after server stops\n      ```\n   b. The parent process (original shim) continues after Daemon::start() returns via process exit in the fork. But since start() calls exit(0) in the parent, the shim needs to fork BEFORE calling start(), or use a different pattern:\n      - Option A: shim forks a child, child calls Daemon::start(), shim continues\n      - Option B: Daemon::start() returns a DaemonResult enum { Parent | Child } instead of exiting\n      - Option C (recommended): Use std::process::Command to spawn the server binary as a separate process, then daemonize THAT process. Simpler but requires server to be a separate binary (which it already is: chesstty-server).\n\n   **Decision needed**: Will Daemon::start() exit the parent (like daemonize crate), or return a discriminant? If it exits, the shim must fork first to preserve its own continuation. Recommend: Daemon::start() exits parent like the crate does, but the shim spawns a child process first that becomes the daemon. The shim parent waits for socket and launches TUI.\n\n3. Create tokio runtime for shim (after fork decision resolves)\n4. wait_for_socket().await\n5. Launch TUI in foreground\n\nKey constraint: NO tokio runtime may exist before fork(). tokio::main is NOT usable on the top-level main — use explicit Runtime::new() after the fork boundary.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"benedikt.schnatterbeck@fresha.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T22:57:42Z","created_by":"Benedikt Schnatterbeck","updated_at":"2026-02-21T23:22:44Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ct-launch.3","depends_on_id":"ct-cli","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T23:23:06Z","created_by":"Benedikt Schnatterbeck","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"ct-launch.3","depends_on_id":"ct-daemon","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T23:23:07Z","created_by":"Benedikt Schnatterbeck","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"ct-launch.3","depends_on_id":"ct-launch","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-21T22:57:42Z","created_by":"Benedikt Schnatterbeck","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"ct-launch.3","depends_on_id":"ct-signal","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T23:23:07Z","created_by":"Benedikt Schnatterbeck","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"ct-launch.3","depends_on_id":"ct-uds","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T23:23:07Z","created_by":"Benedikt Schnatterbeck","metadata":"{}"}]}
